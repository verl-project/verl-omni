# FlowGRPO Trainer

This example shows how to post-train `Qwen-Image` with FlowGRPO on an OCR-style image generation task using `vllm-omni` rollout and a visual generative reward model (`Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` in this example).

For the full installation and quickstart guide, see `docs/start/flowgrpo_quickstart.md`. For algorithm details and rule-based reward training (e.g. JPEG incompressibility), see `docs/algo/flowgrpo.md`.

## Installation

Install dependencies in this order to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# 1. vLLM and vLLM-Omni rollout backend
pip install "vllm==0.18" "vllm-omni==0.18"

# 2. verl
pip install git+https://github.com/verl-project/verl.git@3eab8ccc6143c624e7f11c871896f941b3fec900

# 3. verl-omni
pip install git+https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni.git@main

# 4. FlowGRPO example-specific dependency
pip install Levenshtein
```

For full installation details see `docs/start/install.md`.

The provided script is configured for a single node with `4` GPUs.

## Prepare the dataset

Obtain the raw OCR dataset from the original Flow-GRPO repository:

- https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo/tree/main/dataset/ocr

Place the raw dataset under `$WORKSPACE/data/ocr` (where `WORKSPACE` defaults to `$HOME`), then preprocess it into parquet files:

```bash
python3 examples/flowgrpo_trainer/data_process/qwenimage_ocr.py \
  --input_dir $WORKSPACE/data/ocr \
  --output_dir $WORKSPACE/data/ocr
```

This produces:

- `$WORKSPACE/data/ocr/train.parquet`
- `$WORKSPACE/data/ocr/test.parquet`

## Prepare the models

**Policy model (Qwen-Image):** the script uses the Hugging Face Hub ID `Qwen/Qwen-Image` directly — no manual download is required. Hugging Face will cache the weights automatically on first run. To use a local copy instead, edit the `model_name` variable in the script directly.

**Reward model (Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct):** the script defaults to the Hugging Face Hub ID `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct`, so no manual download is required — Hugging Face will cache it automatically on first run. To use a local copy instead, edit the `reward_model_name` variable in the script directly.

## Run training

Launch the example from the repository root:

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/run_qwen_image_ocr_lora.sh
```

Optional KL loss tuning:

- `actor_rollout_ref.actor.use_kl_loss=True`
- `actor_rollout_ref.actor.kl_loss_coef=0.001`

The script runs `python3 -m verl_omni.trainer.main_flowgrpo` with:

- `algorithm.adv_estimator=flow_grpo`
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.path=Qwen/Qwen-Image`
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_rank=64`
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_alpha=128`
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.name=vllm_omni`
- `reward.reward_manager.name=visual`
- `reward.custom_reward_function.name=compute_score_ocr`
- `trainer.n_gpus_per_node=4`

## Logging

W&B logging is enabled by default in the example script:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_wandb_api_key>
```

The script sets:

```bash
trainer.logger='["console", "wandb"]'
trainer.project_name=flow_grpo
trainer.experiment_name=qwen_image_ocr_lora
```

Override these values on the command line if you want to log under a different project or run name.

### Diffusion-specific metrics

The following metrics are specific to diffusion FlowGRPO training.

**`critic/rewards/zero_std_ratio`** — the fraction of prompt groups (out of
`train_batch_size` prompts) where every one of the `n` generated images
received the same reward, giving a within-group standard deviation of zero.
GRPO derives its learning signal from *relative* rewards within a group, so a
group with zero std contributes no gradient regardless of the absolute reward
value. A persistently high ratio (e.g. above 0.5) means the reward model is
saturated or the task difficulty is poorly calibrated — either all images are
rewarded or none are — and the policy is not receiving useful training signal.

**`critic/rewards/std_mean`** — the mean of the per-prompt reward standard
deviations across all prompt groups in the batch. Complements
`zero_std_ratio`: while `zero_std_ratio` flags completely collapsed groups,
`std_mean` tracks the average reward spread within a group across the whole
batch. A healthy, rising `std_mean` indicates the reward model is producing
diverse signal; a declining `std_mean` is an early warning of reward
saturation before `zero_std_ratio` spikes.

**`actor/pg_clipfrac_higher`** and **`actor/pg_clipfrac_lower`** — these
break down PPO clipping by direction. `pg_clipfrac_higher` is the fraction of
`(image, denoising-timestep)` pairs where the probability ratio
`π_new / π_old` exceeded `1 + clip_ratio`, meaning the policy is trying to
increase the probability of high-advantage images more than the clip allows.
`pg_clipfrac_lower` is the fraction where the ratio fell below
`1 - clip_ratio`, meaning the policy is trying to suppress low-advantage
images more aggressively than allowed. A large asymmetry between the two
(e.g. `higher` >> `lower`) indicates the dominant learning direction and can
guide tuning of `clip_ratio` or the learning rate.

**`timing_per_image_ms/{stage}`** — per-image latency in milliseconds for
each core compute stage: `gen` (rollout), `ref` (reference log-prob),
`old_log_prob`, `adv` (advantage computation), and `update_actor`. Use
these to pinpoint which stage dominates step time.

**`perf/throughput`** — images processed per second per GPU, computed as
`(train_batch_size × rollout.n) / (time_per_step × n_gpus)`.

## Variants

For reward models that are expensive to evaluate (e.g., a VLM judge), the reward model can be allocated its own dedicated GPU resource pool and run asynchronously alongside the policy. This avoids blocking policy training on reward computation.

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_async_reward.sh
```
