    The class for vLLM-Omni's worker to inherit from, in the colocate setting.
    By defining an extension class, the code can work no matter what is
    the underlying worker class. This way, the code can be compatible
    with both vLLM V0 and V1.
    NOTE: we define this class in a separate module, and the main module
